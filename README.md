## Note to the Reviewer

Hey Israel,

I've included two versions for this assignment: one in vanilla JavaScript and another leveraging jQuery and the DataTables library. This approach was chosen to demonstrate versatility in working with both native JavaScript and external libraries effectively.

I hope this submission meets your expectations and showcases my potential contribution to your team! I will attach screenshots and video clips to the PR as well, please take a look and let me know your thoughts.

Best regards,
Tyler
